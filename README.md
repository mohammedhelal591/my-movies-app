# My Movies App - Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

`My Movies App` is an Angular-based web application designed to provide users with an immersive experience for discovering movies and TV series. It leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display a wide range of film and series data, complemented by a secure user authentication system.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Movie and Series Data
The application integrates with the TMDB API to offer comprehensive content exploration:
*   **Trending Content:** Displays the latest trending movies and series.

*   **Series Categories:** Includes a dedicated section for popular TV series.
*   **Details Pages:** Provides detailed information for individual movies and series.

### 2.2 User Authentication
A secure authentication system allows users to manage their accounts:
*   **Registration:** Users can create new accounts.
*   **Login/Logout:** Securely log in and out of their accounts.
*   **Backend Integration:** Authentication logic is handled by a custom backend server hosted on `railway.app`.

## 3. Technical Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** Angular (initially developed with Angular 11, subsequently upgraded to Angular 14 following best practices).
    *   **Deployment:** Configured for deployment on GitHub Pages.
*   **APIs:**
